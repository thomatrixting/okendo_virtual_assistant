# Okendo Virtual Assistant (OVA)

OVA is a virtual assistant running on C++ for most Linux distributions. It uses Whisper and DeepSeek to automate tasks and provide advice on different topics.

## Installation

To install OVA, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
2. Make the installation script executable and run it:

   ```bash
   chmod +x install.sh
   ./install.sh
   ```

## Setup (After Restarting the Terminal)

If you restart your terminal or log in again, you need to run the setup script to configure the environment:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

This ensures all environment variables and dependencies are correctly set up before running OVA.
For now see the examples to see how you can run some dependences
